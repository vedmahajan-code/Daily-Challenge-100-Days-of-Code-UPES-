/*Q102: Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input,
 find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it
 . This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. 
 Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.*/
