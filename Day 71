/*Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode.
 The program should take the user’s name and age as input, 
 and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.*/

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    FILE *fp;
    char name[50];
    int age;
    // Open file in write mode
    fp = fopen("info.txt", "w");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error! Could not create file.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    // Take user input
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    scanf("%49s", name);  // Limit input to avoid buffer overflow
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    // Write data to file
    fprintf(fp, "Name: %s\nAge: %d\n", name, age);
    // Close file
    fclose(fp);
    // Confirmation message
    printf("File created successfully! Data written to info.txt\n");
